# üìä Shopify Sales & Customer Analysis Dashboard

## 1. Short Description / Purpose

The **Shopify Sales & Customer Analysis Dashboard** is a dynamic, interactive Power BI report designed to uncover meaningful insights into **transaction performance, customer purchasing behavior, and long-term customer value** from Shopify sales data. The core objective is to help stakeholders identify patterns in **revenue generation, customer retention, and engagement trends** to support data-driven decision-making.


## 2. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following key technologies:

* **üìä Power BI Desktop** ‚Äì The primary platform used for data modeling, visualization, and report creation.
* **üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** ‚Äì Used extensively for creating all **KPIs** and measures (e.g., Net Sales, Lifetime Value, Repeat Rate) and enabling dynamic visuals.
* **üìÇ Power Query (M Language)** ‚Äì Used for data transformation, cleaning, and preparation of the raw Shopify data.
* **üìù Data Modeling** ‚Äì Relationships were established to enable cross-filtering and accurate aggregation across transactions, customers, and products.


## 3. Data Source

The project uses raw **Shopify sales data**, which includes transaction-level details necessary to calculate performance, customer behavior, and value metrics.


## 4. Features / Highlights

### Business Problem
E-commerce businesses often struggle to move beyond basic sales tracking. They need a system to clearly link daily transactions to broader customer loyalty and retention efforts. Key questions‚Äîsuch as **who the most valuable customers are (LTV)**, **which regions perform best**, and **how purchasing behavior changes over time**‚Äîare difficult to answer without a structured analytical tool.

### Goal of the Dashboard
The goal is to deliver an interactive visual tool that transforms raw sales data into actionable business intelligence by focusing on:
1.  Evaluating the overall **health and effectiveness** of sales operations.
2.  Understanding and segmenting **customer purchase behavior** (single vs. repeat buyers).
3.  Measuring **long-term growth and customer value** metrics.

### Key Visuals & Analysis Sections

The dashboard is structured around three main analytical areas, supported by a dynamic **Measure Selector** that allows users to switch the metric displayed on key charts across **Net Sales, Total Quantity, Total Customers, and Repeat Customers**.

#### A. KPI's Requirements

The report tracks essential metrics across three categories:

| Category | Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Transactions Performance** | **Net Sales** | Total revenue generated before tax. |
| | **Total Quantity** | The cumulative number of products sold. |
| | **Net Avg Order Value** | The average revenue per transaction, excluding tax. |
| **2. Customer Purchase Behavior** | **Total Customers** | The count of unique buyers. |
| | **Single Order Customers** | Customers who placed only one order. |
| | **Repeat Customers** | Customers with more than one order, indicating loyalty. |
| **3. Retention & Value KPIs** | **Lifetime Value (LTV)** | The total revenue generated by a customer over time. |
| | **Repeat Rate** | The percentage of customers who return to make another purchase. |
| | **Purchase Frequency** | How often customers place orders, on average. |

#### B. Regional Overview (Map & City-Level Performance)

* **Filled Map (Province-Level):** Displays province-wise performance using color saturation driven by the selected measure (e.g., darker color for higher Net Sales).
* **Bubble Map / Density Map (City-Level):** Visually represents sales or customer density at a more granular city level.
* **Bar Chart (City-Level Performance):** Compares **top-performing cities** based on the selected KPI, sorted in descending order.

#### C. Sales Trend Over Time

* **Area Chart ‚Äì Trend by Day:** Shows the **daily trend** of the selected measure (e.g., daily Net Sales or daily Repeat Customers), with dynamic interactivity.
* **Bar Chart or Line Chart ‚Äì Trend by Hour:** Displays sales or customer activity by hour of the day (0‚Äì23 hrs) to reveal **peak activity periods** and inform marketing or operational timing decisions.

#### D. Operational Deep Dive

* **Gateway Payment Method:** Identifies the **most and least used payment methods** to detect customer preferences across regions or campaigns.
* **Product Type:** Determines which **product types generate the highest revenue and order volume** and helps understand how customer engagement varies across categories.

#### E. Transaction-Level Detail

A dedicated page is provided to display **transaction-level or detailed data**. This enables users to **drill through** from summary visuals (like charts and KPIs) to see the underlying records, explore data at a granular level, and **validate aggregated metrics** with raw data.


## 5. Business Impact & Insights

* **Marketing Optimization:** By analyzing **Repeat Customers** and **LTV**, stakeholders can identify high-value customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns, improving ROI.
* **Operational Decisions:** The **Trend by Hour** visual enables operations teams to schedule staff or manage inventory based on peak activity periods.
* **Geographic Strategy:** The **Regional Overview** helps identify underdeveloped or high-potential provinces/cities for focused sales and distribution efforts.
* **Product Strategy:** Analysis of **Product Type** revenue and volume allows for informed decisions on inventory stocking and product promotion priorities.
